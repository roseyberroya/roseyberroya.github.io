	  	<h3>About Me</h3>
	  	<p>Leveraging strong functional, technical and leadership skills, I have the ability to excel across a wide spectrum of software integration roles. I have experience taking applications through entire lifecycle processes, from early requirements gathering through post-deployment support. I utilize my skills in analyzing and communicating effectively in order to deliver unique value and build relationships.</p>
	  	<p>Outside the office, I'm a maker. From woodworking to solar etching, I'm constantly involved in projects I can build by hand, to satisfy my right brain. I dabble in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and love organizing ellaborate parties to celebrate friends and family. I am a designer, an optimist, a risk-taker and a challenge-seeker.
